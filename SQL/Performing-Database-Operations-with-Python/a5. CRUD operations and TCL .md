# CRUD Operations – DML and DQL:
Let us get an overview of CRUD Operations. They are nothing but DML and queries to read the data while performing database operations via applications.
* CRUD is widely used from application development perspective.
* C - CREATE (INSERT)
* R - READ (QUERY)
* U - UPDATE (UPDATE)
* D - DELETE (DELETE)

As part of the application development process we perform CRUD Operations using REST APIs.

# TCL – Transaction Control Language:
Let us go through the details related to TCL (Transacton Control Language).
* We typically perform operations such as `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK` via the applications.
* `COMMIT` will persist the changes in the database.
* `ROLLBACK` will revert the uncommitted changes in the database.
* We typically rollback the uncommitted changes in a transaction if there is any exception as part of the application logic flow.
* For example, once the order is placed all the items that are added to shopping cart will be rolled back if the payment using credit card fails.
* By default every operation is typically committed in Postgres. We will get into the details related to transaction as part of application development later.
